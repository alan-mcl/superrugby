# superrugby.py

Tool for backtesting superbru.com predictor models and using them for making future picks in Super Rugby seasons. Includes a tuned ELO-based prediction model that's currently the best I can come up with. 

Pre-COVID the ELO+regression model scored a few top 1% finishes and never finished worse then top 5%.
Can confirm that it does not work for beating the bookies though.
